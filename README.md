# Orionix (backend)
---
This is the backend portion for **Orionix**, a mobile app that lets users find stargazing events and give them realistic guidance regarding whether or not they can experience the event.

Orionix was ***developed in 24 hours*** for [FullyHacks 2025](https://fullyhacks.acmcsuf.com/) Hackathon by myself and [Vladyslav Korenevskyi](https://github.com/tmbkoren).

# Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the backend running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python
- An API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- A [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Batu-end/Orionix-backend.git
    cd Orionix_backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your API keys. Use the `.env.example` file as a template:
    ```
    # .env file
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY="your_openweather_api_key"
    GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="your_google_places_api_key"
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.routes:app --reload
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
